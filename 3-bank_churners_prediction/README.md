Integrative project carried out during the context of Digital House. 

Applying, Data Wrangling (data manipulation and transformation) with Pandas in order to facilitate data consumption.

Data exploratory analysis, utilizing statistical concepts and visualizations (Plotly, Seaborn, Matplotlib). 

Feature engineering to enhance machine learning models using class balancing technics (Oversampling, Undersampling, Class Weighting), feature selection (SelectFromModel, SelectKBest, RFE), feature extraction (PCA). 

Training, implementation, and evaluation of classification models (Logistic Regression), ensemble methods, bagging (Random Forest) and boosting (AdaBoost, XGBoost). Pipeline to automate the workflow required to produce a machine learning model. 

Model deployment using pickle, streamlit and shap (for interpretability)
